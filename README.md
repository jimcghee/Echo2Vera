See the forum thread at:

for instructions on how to install this interface.

I am in the process of modifying this code to

1. Add the word Scene to the end of scene name imported by Echo
2. Modify the Thermostat interface so it works correctly with thermostats programmed in Fahrenheit.
3. Correctly state the thermostat mode when describing actions taken on the thermostat.

One and two appear to work while 3 works when setting temperature but not when increment/decrement.
Finishing 3 is my next task.

If you're already using Martin's interface, just copy and paste in this one over it.  Probably should save your current program first, just in case.

And of course, this comes with the standard disclaimers: 
Use this at your own risk. 
YMMV.
